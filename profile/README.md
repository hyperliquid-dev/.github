**hyperliquid-dev** is an open-source initiative by [Obsidian Audits](https://github.com/obsidianaudits), an elite smart contract security firm.

Here we maintain production-grade libraries and developer tools to make building on HyperEVM seamless and secure.

Get started building with [`hyper-evm-lib`](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dev/hyper-evm-lib), which abstracts away the complexity of HyperEVM<->Core interactions, enabling developers to ship faster and more securely.
